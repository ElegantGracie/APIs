## Overview

### About

This repository would contain different folders containing APIs for different kinds of applications. And of course, each folder would have its name aligned to what it is meant to do and its own README.md for futher description. They would each be hosted too.


### The challenge

The challenge for this project would gradually upscale as I go from beginners ideas upwards.

### Links

This section contains link to each challenge README.
- [Quiz Game](./1-Quiz-Game/README.md)

## My process

### Built with

For now, I would start with Node.js and divert to other languages when I grasp their concepts.

### Continued development

I would discuss new developments under the README.md of each new project folder.

## Acknowledgments

My acknowledgement goes to @Kaperskyguru on X for providing these ideas and all the designers on Behance whom I would use their designs as guide :) (I won't fail to give specific acknowledgments to each in the specified folder README.md)
